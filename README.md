# haskell-ml
Machine Learning in Haskell with a focus on neural networks.

## Features
* Multilayer perceptrons

## WORK IN PROGRESS
Pretty much everything is still missing at this point. Check back from time to time!


### Roadmap
* Backpropagation
* Softmax layer
* Datasets, I/O
* Integrate with MNIST for illustration

### Potential Features
* Convolutional neural networks
* Recurrent neural networks
* Backpropagation through time
* Long-short term memory
* Autoencoders
* ...

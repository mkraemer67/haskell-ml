# haskell-ml
Machine Learning in Haskell with a focus on neural networks.

NOTE: This was mostly an experiment to see how suitable Haskell would be for machine learning related tasks. I am not planning on continuing work on this as there are very mature deep learning frameworks available nowadays.

## Features
* High speed due to hmatrix

## Models

### Neutral Networks
* Multilayer perceptrons

#### Layers
* linear
* hyperbolic
* sigmoid

### Roadmap

#### Upcoming Features for v0.1
* Regression
* Backpropagation
* Datasets, I/O

#### Upcoming Features for v0.2
* Softmax layer
* Classification
* Integrate with MNIST for illustration

#### Features for v0.3+ (no particular order, nothing fixed)
* Modularization
* Convolutional neural networks
* Recurrent neural networks
* Backpropagation through time
* Long-short term memory
* ...

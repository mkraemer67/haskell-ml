# haskell-ml
Machine Learning in Haskell with a focus on neural networks.

NOTE: This is a work in progress in its very early stages.

## Features
* High speed due to hmatrix

## Models

### Neutral Networks
* Multilayer perceptrons

#### Layers
* linear
* hyperbolic
* sigmoid

### Roadmap

#### Upcoming Features for v0.1
* Backpropagation
* Softmax layer
* Datasets, I/O
* Integrate with MNIST for illustration
* Example code
* Simple test case(s)

#### Features for v0.2+ (no particular order, nothing fixed)
* Modularization
* Convolutional neural networks
* Recurrent neural networks
* Backpropagation through time
* Long-short term memory
* Autoencoders
* ...

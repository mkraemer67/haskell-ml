Machine Learning in Haskell

## WORK IN PROGRESS
Pretty much everything is still missing at this point. Check back from time to time!
Main focus will likely lie on neural networks.

### Roadmap
* Multi-layer perceptrons
* Backpropagation
* Softmax layer
* I/O

### Potential Features
* Recurrent neural networks
* Backpropagation through time
* Long-short term memory
* Autoencoders
* ...
